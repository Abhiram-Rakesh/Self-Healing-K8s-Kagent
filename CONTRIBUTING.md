# Contributing

Thank you for taking the time to contribute. This guide covers everything you
need to get from a fresh clone to an open PR.

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/self-healing-k8s-kagent.git
cd self-healing-k8s-kagent

# Install Python runtime + dev tools
make install

# Verify everything works
make lint
make test
```

## Development workflow

1. **Fork** the repository and create a branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes — keep commits focused (one logical change per commit).
3. Run `make lint` and `make test` locally — CI will reject PRs where either fails.
4. Open a pull request against `main` using the PR template.

## Code style

| Tool | What it checks |
|------|----------------|
| `ruff` | Python linting (E/F/W/I rules) |
| `black` | Python formatting (88-char line length) |
| `mypy` | Static type checking (`--ignore-missing-imports`) — **failures block CI** |
| `hadolint` | Dockerfile best practices |
| `shellcheck` | Shell script correctness |
| `terraform fmt` | HCL formatting |
| `helm lint` | Helm chart validity |

Run all of them at once: `make lint`.

## Running tests

```bash
make test
# or directly:
pytest agent/tests/ -v --cov=agent --cov-report=term-missing
```

Tests must not require a live Kubernetes cluster or a real LLM API key —
mock everything at the boundary.

## Adding a new healing action

**Architecture summary:** The LLM tool-calling loop is managed entirely by
kagent (default provider: Claude Haiku; change `spec.declarative.modelConfig`
in `agent.yaml` to switch). Read tools (logs, events, describe) come from
`kagent-tool-server` (built-in). Write tools (restart, scale, cordon, drain)
live in `agent/mcp_server.py` and are exposed as SSE MCP tools that kagent calls.
The system prompt lives in `k8s/kagent/agent.yaml`, not in code.

1. **Add the tool function** to `agent/mcp_server.py`. Write tools must enforce
   the three safety gates in this exact order before touching the cluster:
   ```python
   @mcp.tool()
   def my_action(namespace: str, target: str, confidence: float, reason: str) -> str:
       if (msg := _confidence_gate(confidence)):      return msg
       if (msg := _namespace_gate(namespace)):         return msg   # skip for node actions
       if (msg := _dry_run_gate("my_action", target)): return msg
       # ... actual K8s call ...
       return f"Did my_action on {target}"
   ```
2. **For high-impact actions** (destructive or cluster-wide), add the HITL
   approval flow inside the tool — the `ApprovalStore` pattern in `cordon_node`
   and `drain_node` is the reference implementation. The bridge's
   `POST /approve/<id>` endpoint calls `mcp_server.approval_store.approve()`
   automatically (both run in the same process).
3. **For scale-modifying actions**, store the original replica count in
   `_scale_state[alert_key]` so `scale_down_if_resolved()` can restore it when
   the alert resolves. See `scale_deployment` for the pattern.
4. **Expose the tool in the Agent CRD** by adding its name to the
   `healer-mcp-server` tool list in `k8s/kagent/agent.yaml`. FastMCP registers
   tools with an `_mcp_` prefix, so the name in `toolNames` must match:
   ```yaml
   - type: McpServer
     mcpServer:
       name: healer-mcp-server
       toolNames: [..., _mcp_my_action]
   ```
   After applying (`kubectl apply -f k8s/kagent/agent.yaml`), kagent will
   automatically include the new tool in the LLM's tool schema.
5. **Update the system prompt** in `k8s/kagent/agent.yaml`
   (`spec.declarative.systemMessage`) to tell the agent when and how to use
   the new tool.
6. **Add a Prometheus alert rule** in `k8s/monitoring/alert-rules.yaml` that
   can trigger the new action.
7. **Add unit tests** in `agent/tests/test_mcp_server.py` — cover at least the
   confidence gate, namespace gate, dry-run gate, and the happy path.
8. **Update the healing actions table** in `README.md`.

## Adding a new alert rule

1. Edit `k8s/monitoring/alert-rules.yaml`.
2. Set `kagent: "true"` on the alert label so Alertmanager routes it to the
   webhook.
3. Document it in the "Custom alert rules" section of `README.md`.
4. Test it by applying a test workload from `k8s/test-workloads/`.

## Terraform changes

- Run `terraform fmt -recursive terraform/` before committing.
- Add any new variable to `terraform/variables.tf` with a `description` and
  safe `default`.
- Update `terraform/terraform.tfvars.example` with a commented example value.
- The CI workflow runs `terraform plan` on every PR — check the plan comment
  before merging.

## Safety checklist for MCP tool / alert-rule changes

- [ ] `PROTECTED_NAMESPACES` still includes `kube-system`, `kagent`, `monitoring`
- [ ] All three safety gates (confidence → namespace → dry-run) are the first three lines of every write tool in `agent/mcp_server.py`
- [ ] `DRY_RUN=true` remains the default in `helm/kagent-healer/values.yaml`
- [ ] High-impact actions use the `ApprovalStore` HITL flow (see `cordon_node` / `drain_node`)
- [ ] Scale-modifying actions store their pre-change state in `_scale_state` and are reversed by `scale_down_if_resolved()` on alert resolution
- [ ] New tool is decorated with `@mcp.tool()` and its name is added to the `healer-mcp-server` toolNames list in `k8s/kagent/agent.yaml`
- [ ] System prompt in `k8s/kagent/agent.yaml` is updated to describe when and how the new tool should be called
- [ ] `WEBHOOK_TOKEN` is never hardcoded — leave `agent.webhookToken` empty in `values.yaml` and inject via `extraEnv` referencing a K8s Secret in production

## Helm chart changes

When modifying the Helm chart:

- **New env vars** belong in `helm/kagent-healer/templates/configmap.yaml` (non-sensitive) or injected via `extraEnv` referencing a K8s Secret (sensitive values like tokens or API keys). Never put secret values directly in `values.yaml`.
- **Persistence** is controlled by `persistence.enabled`. When `true`, the chart provisions a PVC and mounts it at `/data`; the configmap automatically overrides `MEMORY_DB_PATH` and `AUDIT_LOG_PATH` to `/data/...`. Dev default is `false` (emptyDir at `/tmp`); production default (`values-prod.yaml`) is `true`.
- **New volumes** must be mounted explicitly in `deployment.yaml` — the root filesystem is read-only (`readOnlyRootFilesystem: true`), so any path the agent writes to needs either an emptyDir or PVC mount.
- Run `helm lint helm/kagent-healer/ --set image.repository=placeholder` before pushing.

## Commit messages

Use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) style:

```
feat: add drain_node healing action
fix: respect APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS in cordon_node
chore: bump python:3.11-slim base image
docs: update README with Loki install step
```

## Releasing

Maintainers cut releases by pushing a semver tag:

```bash
git tag v1.2.3
git push origin v1.2.3
```

CI builds and pushes the versioned image to ECR and creates a GitHub Release
automatically.
